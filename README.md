# Real_time_Domain_Adaptation_in_Semantic_Segmentation

## Abstract
This project investigates the utilization of BiSeNet and DeepLabV2 models for real-time semantic segmentation, with a specific focus on enhancing their performance through domain adaptation techniques. By integrating adversarial training and data augmentation strategies, our goal is to develop robust models capable of achieving better performance across diverse environmental conditions. The subsequent sections will delve into related studies, outline the network architectures and methodologies employed, and present experimental results to showcase the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.
